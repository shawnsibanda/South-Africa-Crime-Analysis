##  Overview
This project analyzes South African crime statistics using Microsoft Excel to identify crime patterns across provinces, crime category distribution, long-term trends, and crime specialization by province through an interactive Excel dashboard.

##  Project Objectives
- Clean and prepare raw crime data for analysis.
- Transform wide-format data into a tidy, analysis-ready structure.
- Perform exploratory data analysis using PivotTables.
- Build a professional and interactive Excel dashboard.
- Communicate insights clearly using data visualization.


##  Dataset
### SouthAfricanCrimeStats.csv   
Coverage Includes:
- Provinces.
- Police stations.
- Crime categories.
- Reporting years (2005–2016).

### Cleaning Steps
- Converted the CSV file to Excel format.
- Standardized column headers.
- Removed duplicate records.
- Identified and removed missing or invalid values.
- Converted multiple year columns into a tidy format using Power Query.
- Ensured correct data types for all columns.

## Business Questions
- What are the top two provinces that report the most crime overall?
- Is crime increasing or decreasing over time?
- Which crime types dominate national statistics?
- What are the crime categories dominating each province?
- Are certain crime categories increasing or decreasing over time?
- Which provinces show the most significant long-term improvement?


##  Dashboard Features
The Excel dashboard includes the following components:

- **Bar Chart:** Total reported crime by province.  
- **Line Chart:** National crime trends over time.  
- **Column Chart:** Crime distribution by category.
- **Stacked Column Chart:** Crime specialization by province.  
- **Slicers:** Interactive filters for Province, Category, and Year.  


## Key Insights
- The top three provinces that report the most crime:
1. Gauteng.
2. Western Cape.
3. Kwazulu Natal.
- Crime trends show noticeable changes over time.
- A small number of crime categories account for a large share of reported cases.
- While overall crime may decline, some specific crime categories show upward trends, highlighting emerging risks that require monitoring.
- Certain provinces like Free State and Mpumalanga, demonstrate reductions in reported crime over time, potentially reflecting effective local policing strategies or behavioural improvements.

## Recommendations to help reduce the crime rates.
- Focus law-enforcement resources on provinces contributing the largest share of national crime.
- Design tailored strategies per crime category, rather than using a single national approach. For example: GBV - community patrols, property damage - CCTV.
- Invest in community programmes such as Neighborhood Watches, in areas with persistent high crime rates.
